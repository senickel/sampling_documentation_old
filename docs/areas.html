<p>The <code>geosampling::prepare_sampling_bins_city</code> function draws two circles around a point and splits both circles along the horizontal and the vertical axis in 8 pieces.<br />
The function takes in the arguments <code>adm0</code> for a variable of class <code>SpatialPolygons</code>, which contains the national border of the respective country, the coordinates of the respective city (<code>coords</code>), a variable of class <code>SpatialPolygons</code>, which contains lakes, and <code>radius_inner_circle</code> and <code>radius_outer_circle</code> to determine the radius of both circles.</p>

<p>There are two border areas of interest: the border area between Kenya and Tanzania on the one hand and the border area between Malawi, Tanzania, and Zambia on the other.<br />
Since the border between those states is the defining element for the respective sampling area, they are discussed separately.</p>

<p>The land border between Kenya and Tanzania is the defining element and we can extract it by simply loading the Tanzanian <code>SpatialPolygonsDataFrame</code>, which includes the third administrative division. Waterbodies are declared as such and they are easily removed. In the next step, the <code>SpatialPolygons</code> object is transformed to a <code>SpatialLines</code> object and is cropped by the national borders of Kenya.<label for="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number">3</label><input type="checkbox" id="tufte-sn-3" class="margin-toggle"><span class="sidenote"><span class="sidenote-number">3</span> There is a 1 meter buffer around Kenya to make sure it overlaps with the <code>SpatialLines</code> object.</span> The most Western and Eastern points of the border are selected which we will need for the constructions of the bin.</p>

</p>
<p>The border between Kenya and Tanzania is the start point for building the sampling areas. In our project we want to stratify by a 0-50 and a 50-100 km border area (Figure <a href="areas.html#fig:plotkenyaborder">2.4</a> Panel A). Both areas are successively built by implementing the function <code>prepare_sampling_area</code>. The 50-100 km area is constructed in a way that it overlaps with the 0-50 km area and then is cut in the following step. This way we make sure that we do not have any empty space between those two areas.<br />
Finally, we pass both areas in the <code>prepare_sampling_bins</code> function, which further divides both areas in 5 more or less equally sized bins which will serve as the secondary sampling unit (Figure <a href="areas.html#fig:plotkenyaborder">2.4</a> Panel B). Here, the variable <code>start_end</code> comes in handy because a simple line is drawn to connect both points and the split it into 5 equally sized areas.</p>

<p>The approach for the whole Southern border situation is a bit more complicated since there are no natural cut-off points such as the sea for the Northern border area. Furthermore, the shore of lake Tanganyika in the Western border area between Tanzania and Zambia is part of the line that will be used to draw the sampling area. On the Zambian side, the sampling line stops at the point where Zambia shares a border with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The cut-off for the sampling line on the Tanzanian side is determined by the prolonged border line between the DRC and Zambia.</p>

<p>The Southern border area of Tanzania is also cutted off. In general, the lake sides might provide interesting variation, however this is not true if the country on the opposite shore does not belong to the countries under investigation. Hence, the prolonged Zambian border line is used to clipp the buffer zone (Figure <a href="areas.html#fig:tanzsouthern">2.9</a> Panel A). Note that the two most Western 50-100 km bins were merged, because of the small size of one of them (Panel B).</p>
