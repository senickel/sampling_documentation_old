# Introduction

The book is divided into four broad chapters that contain all necessary steps
to replicate the sampling for GLD's urbanization project.  
The following chapter discusses and walks through how the necessary spatial polygon files are constructed.
The third chapter focus on the preparation of the sampling areas, whereas the fourth chapter

different tables for selected key variables.
